### Short example of Bulma being implemented 
```html
  <div class="flexbox">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="columns is-two-fifths">
      <div class="column">
        <label class="label">Find the Best Coffee in any City</label>

```

#### Bulma Responsive Design

### Example of javascript code used to fetch coffee shop names and addresses from Bing Map API
```JS
var bingApiUrl = "https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/LocalSearch/?query=cafe&userLocation=" + coordinates[0] + "," + coordinates[1] + ",5000&key=" + bingApiKey;
    fetch(bingApiUrl).then(function (response) {
      if (response.ok) {
      response.json().then(function (bingData) {
        var coffeeShopsEl = document.getElementById("coffeeShops");
          coffeeShopsEl.innerHTML = '';
          var cafeData = bingData.resourceSets[0].resources;
          console.log(cafeData);
          for (var i = 0; i < cafeData.length; i++) {
            var coffeeShop = {
                name: cafeData[i].name,
                coordinate: cafeData[i].point.coordinates,
                address: cafeData[i].Address.formattedAddress
            }
                coffeeShopsData.push(coffeeShop);
                showcoffeeShop(coffeeShop);
                var cityWordArray = cityName.split("%20");
                cityName = cityWordArray.join(" ");
                Search(cityName)
                }
            })
        }}
    );

### Calling Open Weather Map API 
``` js
function handleCallingApis(cityName) {
    var coordinates = [];

    fetch(GeoApiUrl).then(function (response) {
        if (response.ok) {

                //If the city is not found, the length of data list will be empty
                if (geoData.length === 0) {
                    // alert("The searched city is not found!");
                    citySearch.value = "";
                    var searchedCityModal = document.getElementById('searchedCityModal');

                }
                else {

                    saveSearch(cityName);
                    //call the map api to show the curent city
                    var weatherApiUrl = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=" + coordinates[0] + "&lon=" + coordinates[1] + "&appid=" + weatherApiKey;

                                var tempFarenheit = parseFloat(((todayData.main.temp - 273) * 1.8) + 32).toFixed(2);
                                var cityWordArray = cityName.split("%20");

Short example of additional styling that was added after Bulma layout
```css
#coffeeShops{
    display:flex;
    flex-direction:column;
    height: 300px;
    box-shadow: 5px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    padding: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

## Usage 

Once the deployed site link is opened, the user can start their search for a new cafe using the search box by entering a city of their choosing. The page will dynamically update and display coffee shops of the inputed city, generating the name and adresses in a scroll list. That same search will also produce a randomly generated quote of the day and the current weather conditions of the city searched will be displayed in the top right of the page, which can be seen within the image below.

## Learning Points 

The authors have learned to do research into API and server-side API independent of assistance and learned to overcome issues of implementation if there were any. We also learned to pivot to use alternative API providers to fit our user story. Problem-solving minds were needed in developing application as a group.
We have learned to tie different information from different API to make useful applications that can be used in real life.
We have explored and found that there are numerous resources that we can use and how we can improve our applications for the future. We have also learned how to implement agile working practices and to overcome issues such as Git merge conflicts.
