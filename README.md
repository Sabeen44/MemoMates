## Usage 

This website is very simple and quick to get started. After visiting the site with the link from above, users are asked to login. If no previous account exists the user may sign up simply by clicking the sign up button, this will take the user to a page that will ask for their name, email, and password. After creating an account the user is taken to the New Connections landing page where the user can enter details of the person who they lost connection with. All previous notes and connection details are then rendered to the homepage where the user can view them all. Lastly after 5 minutes the user will be automatically signed out for security purposes, otherwise they can manually logout by clicking the logout button within the header
